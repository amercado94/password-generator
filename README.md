# password-generator

## Description
I worked on a random password generator. Given starter code I set out to make the generator ask for a number of characters (8-128) and whether it wanted to include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and/or symbols in the password. After all prompts have been answered the website generates a random password following the parameters set by the user. If the parameters are not set by the user or set outside of the correct parameters then the user will get a message to try again.
